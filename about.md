Software developer living in Seattle. I grew up in Boston and graduated from Vanderbilt class of 2016. Originally wanted to work in proof-based mathematics, but when the math factory down the street from my house shut down, I decided to try coding. Graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering, with a second major in math. In case the factory ever re-opens. Main focus is on Machine Learning and Compuational Learning Theory, with applications to Game Theory and Bioinformatics. Currently working for AWS, where I do software backed networking for elastic cloud computing.
